Once code is reviewed and approved, the changes are then merged into our `master` branch.

3. Implement your feature or bug fix.
4. Add, commit, and push your changes.
  - `git add -A`
  - `git commit -m "Brief explanation of the implementation"`
  - `git push`
5. Submit a [Merge Request](https://gitlab.decathlon.net/sportplaces/api/merge_requests/new) through [Gitlab](https://gitlab.decathlon.net/sportplaces/api/)
