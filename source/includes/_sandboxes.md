# Sandboxes

If you're looking for places to play around with these API calls and/or just run
tests against your application, you might want to try our sandbox environments:

## Staging

URL: [https://sportplaces-api-staging.herokuapp.com](https://sportplaces-api-staging.herokuapp.com)

This environment is a replica of our production environment, with a
representative dataset and fully functional API endpoints

## Development (Bleeding-edge)

URL: [https://sportplaces-develop.herokuapp.com](https://sportplaces-develop.herokuapp.com)

This environment is NOT recommended for production. This contains the latest
additions to our API and some of them might not yet be ready for usage. Even
though most of what's here is soon to be deployed, we cannot guarantee it will
continue to work as features are still being tested/developed.
