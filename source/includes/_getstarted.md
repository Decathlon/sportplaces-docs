# Get started

The Sport Places API can help you build sport-related applications requiring sport places. Here are a few steps to get you started:

**1. Sign up as an API User to receive important communications (mandatory).**

To keep our API Users happy, we will want to make sure we can inform about amazing upgrades or important changes.

Sign up by filling this form: [http://eepurl.com/ggGaRP](http://eepurl.com/ggGaRP)

**2. Learn how authenticate.**

To get a `client_id` and `JWT Tokens`, go to [Authentication](#authentication)

**3. Make your first API Call!**

You are ready to go! We suggest you make your first API Call calling the sport places around you. Let's start with [Sport Places](#sport-places).
