# Sport Places API documentation

These docs are powered by [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate). Slate produces plain old static HTML files after
compilation with Middleman. It is these HTML files that we publish on the Internet. This repository itself should not be
deployed anywhere, because of performance and security concerns.

## Markdown

The documentation is written in Markdown. For more information see
[the Markdown spec](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

Some HTML is also permitted, but keep it simple.
